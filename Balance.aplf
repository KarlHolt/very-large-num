 res←Balance a;fix

 ⍝ Walk from right to left through the bits and fix the overflows (2's)
 ⍝ A reduction walks from the left :)
 ⍝ To make the reduction work on the leftmost bit, add a 0 and remove it later

 fix←{
     (⊃⍵)∊0 1:⍺,⍵ ⍝ nothing to balance
     (⍺+1),0,1↓⍵  ⍝ overflow in this bit
 }
